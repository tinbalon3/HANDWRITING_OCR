# Handwriting Recognition using CNN and ResNet

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a handwriting recognition system using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** combined with **Residual Networks (ResNet)**. The aim is to build a robust model capable of recognizing both letters and digits from handwritten input images.

The solution addresses challenges such as style variations, image noise, and distortions by leveraging modern deep learning techniques.

## Project Objectives
- Design and implement a hybrid CNN-ResNet architecture to improve recognition accuracy for handwritten letters and digits.
- Train the model on diverse datasets, including MNIST and A-Z handwritten datasets.
- Address common deep learning challenges like vanishing gradients and overfitting using skip connections and regularization techniques.

## Dataset
- **MNIST:** Contains 60,000 training and 10,000 test images of digits (0–9), each 28x28 pixels.
- **A-Z Handwritten Dataset:** Includes 372,451 samples of uppercase handwritten letters.

Both datasets are preprocessed to:
1. Resize images to 32x32 pixels.
2. Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].
3. Combine into a unified dataset for training and testing.

## Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract spatial features from input images.
- **Residual Blocks:** Introduce skip connections to alleviate vanishing gradient issues.
- **Batch Normalization:** Stabilize and accelerate training.
- **Activation (ReLU):** Add non-linearity to the model.
- **Global Average Pooling:** Reduce spatial dimensions before classification.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Output class probabilities for 36 classes (A-Z and 0-9).

## Training
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Optimizer:** Adam with an exponential learning rate decay.
- **Loss Function:** Categorical cross-entropy.
- **Augmentation:** Applied random rotations, shifts, and scaling to improve model robustness.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy on both test and validation datasets. Evaluation includes:
1. Loss and accuracy metrics across epochs.
2. Cosine similarity analysis for embeddings generated by the model.

## How to Use
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/handwriting-recognition.git
   cd handwriting-recognition
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
### Training the Model
Run the training script:
```bash
python train_ocr_model.py --az a_z_handwritten_data.csv --model handwriting.model
```

### Run the Model with images in folder images and evalute in the same place
```bash
python ocr_handwriting.py --model handwriting.model --image images/umbc_address.png
```


## Future Work
- Extend the model to recognize handwritten text in sequences.
- Optimize the architecture for real-time applications on mobile and embedded devices.
